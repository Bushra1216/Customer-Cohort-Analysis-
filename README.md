<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p align=justify>
Retail businesses often struggle to understand why customers stop purchasing and which customer groups contribute most to the long-term revenue. Without clear visibility into retention, churn, and returning customer behavior—businesses cannot design effective strategies to sustain growth. Cohort Analysis is the process of analyzing customer behavior that allows us to gain a deeper understanding of customer movement and business performance by grouping individuals based on a shared characteristic—most commonly the month they made their first purchase and tracking their behavior over subsequent periods.

By analyzing Cohorts, businesses can-
- Identify churn and recovery behaviors of customer
- Detect retention patterns
- Understand spending trends across months

Monitoring these Cohorts help businesses pinpoint opportunities to improve customer engagement and revenue generation.
In this project, customers are segmented based on their first purchasing month and their activity is monitored across following months to gain valuable insights, which help measure the effectiveness of retention strategies and identify areas for improvement.<p>

Examining revenue generation across cohorts, this will help businesses to identify cohorts that contribute significantly on revenue growth and detect declining cohorts that may require targeted marketing or retention efforts to enhance their value.
